## FAQ

> Will Xiao ever be public again?

[No. :)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1219787468614795295&scope=bot&permissions=8)

> Will Xiao ever support Slash Commands?

Most likely, no. Many of the commands in Xiao were written with the message content intent in mind,
and given her status as a private bot I see no reason to change that. Plus, kitchen-sink bots
really _don't_ work with Slash Commands, they just clog up the list.

> Can I use part of Xiao's code (i.e. a command) in my bot?

I don't really care, but please give credit in some form if you do so. You'll also be subject to
`LICENSE.md`, and I won't provide you with any support if it doesn't work.

> Can I host Xiao myself?

If you want, good luck. Setting her up is a pretty difficult task.

> Do I need every API key, emoji ID, etc.?

No, but some commands may not work without them.

> Do I need to set up Redis?

Yes, several commands and functions rely on it.

> Do I really need to install Wine and Wine32 on Linux?

Only if you want to use the DECTalk command.

> Where can I find DECTalk?

Good question! I don't even remember where I found it, and I really can't help you. While it's
probably considered abandonware and I doubt anyone would go after a private Discord bot of all
things, I'm not taking any chances.
